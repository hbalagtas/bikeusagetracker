                    <p>Welcome to Cycle Parts Usage Tracker, the primary goal of the site is to help you keep track of how much mileage you are putting on your bike and its components. I've created the project because I found the feature lacking in Strava, one purpose I had in mind was for my beater bike, I normally switch between summer, fall and winter tire and would like to keep track of the mileage I put on each tire.</p>

                    <p>I've found other sites that aim to do something similar but I didn't like their approach of adding components. I wanted to make things simpler and easier for me to use as well, and so I've decided to make my own for my personal use and maybe for others as well. Having a Strava account is optional but it makes it easier to track your miles, I've been using it ever since I got started into cycling in 2014.</p>
